ðŸ“š Book Management System
This Book Management System is a PHP-based web application that allows users to explore a library of books across multiple genres. The system supports two types of users: managers and regular users.

Key Features:
User Roles:

Manager: Managers have full control over the book catalog. They can add, update, or delete book details.
Regular User: Regular users can browse through the book collection, check book details, and add books to their favorites list. However, they do not have permission to modify book details.
Multi-Page Navigation: The application is designed with a multi-page structure, allowing users to navigate through different sections of the library seamlessly.

Book Categories: Books are categorized by genre, making it easy for users to find titles that match their interests.

User Authentication: Secure login system with different access levels for managers and regular users.

This project showcases my skills in PHP development, user authentication, role-based access control, and building dynamic web applications with multiple pages and content management features.
